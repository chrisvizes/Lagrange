a blog about how the pandemic has affected my feeling of involvement in the community

I have next to no contact with the information lab anymore (combining placement with pandemic)

I don't see anyone present their work or get to discuss it with them

I feel too awkward to talk to anyone from work about Tableau or Alteryx over a call and I don't just bump into them.

I stopped blogging
