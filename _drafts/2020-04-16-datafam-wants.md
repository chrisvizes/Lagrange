## What Kind of Formatting?

Significant figures, explain with table showing numbers converted to various degrees of significant figures

Significant figures and units (k,m,b), explain with table showing numbers converted to various degrees of significant figures

### Single calculation formatting a number into a string to N decimal places and units

### A calculation for each 'kind' of formatting, making use of built-in Tableau formatting
