Welcome to my blog, here's a little bit about myself and my background.

# Who is this guy anyway?
My name is Chris and I am currently a Trainee Consulting Analyst for The Information Lab. Here, I have recieved 4 months of dedicated Tableau and Alteryx training by some of the leading members in these communities. Following this training I will be consulting for 4 x 6 month placements in a variety of industries.

*But the job isn't me*

## Other things I associate with
I have a BSc in **Physics** (2:1) from the University of **Bristol** where I took particular interest in my **computational** and **experimental** units (i.e. exams no thank you). While there I had the pleasure of working with the physics society **[Chaos](www.bristolchaos.com)** in a variety of roles, spending my final year as the President.
