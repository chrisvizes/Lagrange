Welcome to my blog, here's a little bit about me and my background.

## My Current Role
I am a Trainee Consulting Analyst for The Information Lab. Here, I have recieved 4 months of dedicated Tableau and Alteryx training by some of the leading members in these communities (**[Data School](https://www.thedataschool.co.uk/)**). Following this training I will be consulting for 4 x 6 month placements in a variety of industries. 

## University
I have a BSc in **Physics** (2:1) from the University of **Bristol** where I took particular interest in my **computational** and **experimental** units (i.e. exams no thank you).

While there I had the pleasure of working with the physics society **[Chaos](https://www.bristolchaos.com)** in a variety of roles, spending my final year as the President. The 18-person strong committee managed to achieve the Best Academic & Careers Society award from the National Union of Students in 2018.

## Tutoring
A passion of mine revolves around tutoring and **science communication**. Helping someone achieve a lightbulb moment and get enthusiastic about a subject has been a focus of mine across a variety of roles and I am always looking to help others. I've been a personal tutor, an overseas academic mentor, a study session leader and have been attempting translating this experience over to the world of data visualisation.

## Uni-Truths Ltd
As a Director of [Uni-Truths](https://www.uni-truths.com), I have helped evolve this web platform into a tool used by over 500 users across much of the worlds universities. Within this role was how I first gained experience and interest in Tableau Desktop to firstly see what the software could do for *me*, but evolved into creating a variety of dashboards to provide analytics into the business itself. **I was my first and longest client.** 

## Awards & Accreditations
- **Tableau Desktop Certified Associate** (Jan 2020)
    - Achieved via an exam demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of functionality in Tableau Desktop.
- **Alteryx Designer Core** (Dec 2019)
    - Achieved via an exam demonstrating comfort with the core tooling of Alteryx Designer.
